                    <h2>Hello, I am Jessica Donley, an artist passionate about video games!</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently an undergraduate junior at SUNY University at Albany, with a Computer Science
                        Major and an Art Minor. I've been drawing and coding since I was young.
                    </p>
                    <p>Digital art is my main art medium, which I have been using since I was 14 years old.
                        I have created my own characters and stories, and I love to create fan art of my favorite characters.
                    </p>
                    <p>Gaming is something that I've had an avid interest in since I was little. I grew up playing
                        video games, and as such have a huge fondness for. I love to incorporate it in my work, whether
                        that be art, coding, or working on my own video game projects. I personally play games using PC, Xbox, and
                        have played on Nintendo and Sony consoles in the past. My favorite genre of games include RPGs, action, beat em' ups, and
                        roguelikes.
                    </p>
                    <p>I've had an interest in coding since I was in elementary school, starting with Scratch when I was about 10. Once I reached high school,
                        I joined the school's robotics team. I quickly became the lead programmer, eventually becoming the captain
                        for my junior and senior years. After graduating, I became a mentor for the team for 2 years.
                        Through robotics, I learned Java, and thus decided to pursue a degree in computer science.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My main mediums in art consist of digital, charcoal, graphite, and gouache. I love to work with illustration, such as concept art,
                        large scale drawings, and comics.
                    </p>
                    <p>My main programming languages are Java, C, HTML, and CSS. I use GameMaker Studio 2 for game development. When pushing my code to
                        Github, I use GitBash.
                    </p>
