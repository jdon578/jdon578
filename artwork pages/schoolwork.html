                            <h3>Charcoal, Cardboard, Colored Pencils, Ink Pens, 36" x 48"</h3>
                            <p>This is a self-portrait for my Intermediate Drawing Midterm. For the midterm, we were given two options -- either create a series
                                of four drawings, or one big drawing, with an emphasis of collage. I picked the second option. I decided to take my love for video games
                                and create a collage to give the illusion that the drawing is taking place in a video game. I used cardboard to make parts of the drawing
                                pop out, with all of the colored parts being glued on to the charcoal.

                            <p>Our first assignment for Intermediate Drawing was to create a "creature" using everyday materials, and to then
                                imagine what that creature might look like if they were alive. My group created this creature (top drawing) using
                                modeling clay, tinfoil, tape, wire, newspaper, and rhinestones. For the second drawing, I interpreted it as being
                                a zombie-like creature, with large, slimy "tentacles".

                                multiple props. I decided to use an old phone and toy cash register to create a scene where I was checking someone out.

                            <p>My Life Drawing midterm was to create a master copy in charcoal. I picked the painting "Figure 11.23" by Jenny Saville, a
                                UK-based painter. I focused on emulating the paint strokes using the texture of the charcoal.
