                            <p>This is a drawing of Riku from Kingdom Hearts, which I did during my replay of Kingdom Hearts. He is holding Soul
                                Eater, his sword, in front of his face, while in Dark Mode. I used primarily dark purples and reds, not only
                                since that was his color scheme in that outfit, but to also make his face and the bright blues pop.

                            <p>This is a drawing of my OCs, Rina and Melania. I used mainly red, white, and black to both make the 
                                characters stand out, and to put the emphasis on Melania, who has red in her design. I hid most
                                of Rina's face to further put emphasis on Melania, who is staring at the viewer.

                                of the characters. Since I usually draw with a lot of warm hues, I decided to focus on using cooler hues
                                for this drawing.
